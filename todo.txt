TODOLIST:

- clean up composition.py
- slb vs slb_third.py duplicate a lot, avoid that
x consistently order functions that return or accept v_s,v_p,v_phi: order is now v_p, v_s, v_phi (Sanne)
- what needs to be done for spin transitions?
x check attenuation correction and write an example (Sanne, Cayman): attenuation as formulated by Matas is a 0.3% correction (less for P wave velocity). Do we care about this?
- input Ca/Al
- mass balance calculation, Yu?
- document examples (see example_composition.py)
- document classes and functions in burnman better, specify units!
- should we split up example_composition.py? Opinions? Timo: yes, try to teach creating of minerals separately. Cayman: I agree. Let's just do this Timo.
- order examples (figure out dependencies for that), see bottom of readme.txt
- write a manual (what needs to go in here? Nothing but the order of the examples?) Sanne: in the matlab package MSAT, I noticed their manual on the examples was made up out of blocks of text at the top of the examples. I'm not 100% sure yet how they did this. It seems usefull, when we update examples, that the manual changes consistently. 
-adiabatic geothermal, super adiabatic(Sanne? Do we need this?)
- Test the forward problem further, make sure we don't make a mistake with Murakamis results (V_phi?, Sanne: V_phi is alarming different between slb and mgd)
- long term: setup inverse model runs, what makes sense here?
- write burnman paper
- write MgSi paper
- Convert from cc to SI in seismic files

DONE:
- fix benchmark.py
x Make VRH a stand alone function (finished this off, somebody had already written the function, Sanne)
- unify importing of burnman (Timo)
x call it burnman instead of code (Timo/Sanne)
- isothermal/adiabatic bulk modulus
- Timo: geotherm as burnman.geotherm.shankland() (Timo)
- Timo: use phases = [...], instead of phases=(...) (Timo)
- release burnman v0.2 (Timo)
- example_compare_enstpyro.py outputs negative density?! (not true, that is neg. difference)
x write summary for each example as a comment at the top (see example_composition.py) Cayman: Done for the most part
- Clean up plotting (Timo)
- Give 2nd/3rd order approximation option as a different method so we can compare them, Sanne: should we make the method depend on the mineral used? So the method and order used can be in the params? (Cayman) (Created a new method slb3 for the third order stuff)
