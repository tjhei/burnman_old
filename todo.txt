TODOLIST:


- Timo: use phases = [...], instead of phases=(...)
- document classes and functions
- example_compare_enstpyro.py outputs negative density?!
- Timo: geotherm as burnman.geotherm.shankland()
- what needs to be done for spin transitions?
- check attenuation correction and write an example (Sanne, Cayman)
- input Ca/Al
- mass balance calculation, Yu?
- write summary for each example as a comment at the top
- document examples
- order examples (figure out dependencies for that)
- write a manual (what needs to go in here? Nothing but the order of the examples?)
- isothermal/adiabatic bulk modulus, Ian. Status?
- Test the forward problem further, make sure we don't make a mistake with Murakamis results (V_phi?)
- Give 2nd/3rd order approximation option as a different model so we can compare them
- long term: setup inverse model runs, what makes sense here?

DONE:
- unify importing of burnman (Timo)
- call it burnman instead of code (Timo)
