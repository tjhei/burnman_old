*** About

burnman is a lower mantle shear velocity generator constrained by mineral physics.

Work started by a work-group of the CIDER 2012 workshop in Santa Barbara.

see: http://code.google.com/p/burnman/

burnman is released under the GNU GPL v2 or newer


*** Requirements

- Python 2.7 (not Python 3.x)
- Python modules:
  NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib


*** Install under Ubuntu

1. sudo apt-get install python python-scipy python-numpy python-matplotlib 
2. run with "python main.py" in a shell


*** Install on a MAC

0. get Xcode
1. If you don't have Python yet, download it (for free) from python.org/download . Make sure you have the latest version (I used 2.7). To check your version of python, type the following in a terminal:
	python --version
2. Install the latest Numpy version: http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/
3. Install the latest Scipy at http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/
4. Install the latest Matplotlib from http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.1.1/
5. Go to the main BurnMan directory and type:
	python main.py
    Figures should show up.


Problems you might run into:
	- Installing numpy/scipy/matplotlib for a different python version than the one on your 	computer
	- Having matplotlib for 32-bit instead of 64-bit (for me this got fixed by installing the very latest 	version). This will give you the error 'no matching architecture in universal wrapper'. You can 	check if your python is 32 or 64 bit with the following lines:
		python
		>>> import platform
		>>> print platform.architecture()


*** Install under Windows

make Python 2.7.3 (for example) running under windows (do not use Python 3.x, but 2.7.x):

1. Download Python from http://www.python.org/ and install the version at C:\Python27\; the 32-bit version is recommended
2. Go to http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy, download "numpy-MKL-1.6.2.win32-py2.7.exe" and install
3. Go to http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy, download "scipy-0.10.1.win32-py2.7.exe" and install
4. Go to http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib, download "matplotlib-1.1.1.win32-py2.7.exe" and install
5. Open Python Shell (IDLE Python GUI)
6. File -- Open -- find one of the example files
7. Run the module (or press F5)


*** Examples

* example_geotherms.py

Shows the various ways to input geotherms: Built-in geotherms (geotherm1 and 2), basic linear (geotherm3),
loaded in from a data file (geotherm4) of your choice. Geotherm 1 is from Brown & Shankland (1981) and 
geotherm2 from Watson & Baxter (2007).

requires:

teaches:
- geotherms


* example_geotherms.py

Shows the various ways to input geotherms: Built-in geotherms (geotherm1 and 2), basic linear (geotherm3),
loaded in from a data file (geotherm4) of your choice. Geotherm 1 is from Brown & Shankland (1981) and 
geotherm2 from Watson & Baxter (2007).

requires:

teaches:
- geotherms


* example_seismic.py

Shows the various ways to input seismic models (Vs, Vp, Vphi, Density) as a
function of depth (or P) as well as different velocity models available:
PREM (Dziewonski & Anderson, 1981)
reference model for fast regionsi (outside the LLSVP's) in the lower mantle (Lekic et al. 2012)
reference model for slow regions (LLSVP's) in the lower mantle (Lekic et la. 2012)

requires:

teaches:
- seismic models


* example_compare_two_models.py

Calculates and plots two models for different minerals or methods and plots
the results. Calculates basic percent difference statistics as well.

requires:
- geotherms
- creating minerals

teaches:
- compute seismic velocities and compare

* example_composition.py

This example shows how to create different minerals, how to compute seismic
velocities, and how to compare them to a seismic reference model.

requires:
- geotherms
- seismic models
- compute seismic velocities

teaches:
- creating minerals
- seismic comparison


* example_woutput.py

Compute properties of minerals and creates a table of outputs in a text format
that could be used with other programs.

requires:
- creating minerals
- compute seismic velocities
- geotherms

teaches:
- output computed seismic data to file 


* example_user_input_material.py

Shows user how to input a mineral of his/her choice and which physical values
need to be input for BurnMan to calculate Vs, Vp, Vphi and density at depth.

requires:
- creating minerals
- compute seismic velocities
- geotherms
- seismic models
- seismic comparison

teaches:
- how to create your own minerals


* example_compare_enstpyro.py

This example shows you how to create two materials from wt% determines the
optimum mixing between the two to match the seismic model of your choice.

requires:
- geotherms
- seismic models
- compute seismic velocities
- creating minerals

teaches:
- weight percent materials


* example_optimize_pv.py

Vary the amount perovskite vs. ferropericlase and compute the error in the
seismic data against PREM.

requires:
- creating minerals
- compute seismic velocities
- geotherms
- seismic models
- seismic comparison

teaches:
- compare errors between models
- loops over models


* example_spintransition.py

This example shows the different minerals that are implemented with a spin transition.
Minerals with spin transition can be included in burnman/minerals.py by defining parameters for the low spin state. Regular parameters are by definition high spin and the second set of paramaters must be named 'self.params_LS'. This set of parameters should include a transition pressure called 'P_LS' in GPa. This example shows the minerals for which spin transitions are implemented. 

requires:
- geotherms
- seismic models
- compute seismic velocities

teaches:
- spin transitions
