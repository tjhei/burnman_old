TODOLIST:

- consistently order functions that return or accept v_s,v_p,v_phi
- example_compare_enstpyro.py outputs negative density?!
- what needs to be done for spin transitions?
- check attenuation correction and write an example (Sanne, Cayman)
- input Ca/Al
- mass balance calculation, Yu?
- write summary for each example as a comment at the top (see example_composition.py)
- document examples (see example_composition.py)
- document classes and functions in burnman better, specify units!
- should we split up example_composition.py? Opinions?
- order examples (figure out dependencies for that), see bottom of readme.txt
- write a manual (what needs to go in here? Nothing but the order of the examples?)
- isothermal/adiabatic bulk modulus, Ian. Status?
- Test the forward problem further, make sure we don't make a mistake with Murakamis results (V_phi?)
- Give 2nd/3rd order approximation option as a different model so we can compare them
- long term: setup inverse model runs, what makes sense here?
- write burnman paper
- write MgSi paper

DONE:
- unify importing of burnman (Timo)
- call it burnman instead of code (Timo)
- Timo: geotherm as burnman.geotherm.shankland() (Timo)
- Timo: use phases = [...], instead of phases=(...) (Timo)
- release burnman v0.2 (Timo)
